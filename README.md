# Etch-a-Sketch

## Description

This project was made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript

In this project I was wanted to show how manipulating the DOM can create a fun project that is appealing to the eye.

Some of the challenges that I have faced when creating this project was finding out how to create a responsive grid that is 
able to change depending on the users choice. 

This project thought be how the scope of a variable matters and what can be done to solve Local vs Global variable scope. If you
into an issue with it.

This was also the first project I have attempted to make responsive using **media queries**
